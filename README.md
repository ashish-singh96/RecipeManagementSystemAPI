## Recipe Management System API - README

### Frameworks and Language Used
- Framework: Spring Boot
- Language: Java

### Data Flow
#### Controller
- UserController: Handles user-related endpoints (registration, login, etc.).
- RecipeController: Manages recipe-related endpoints (CRUD operations, search, etc.).
- CommentController: Manages comment-related endpoints (add comment, read comments).

#### Services
- UserService: Handles user-related business logic.
- RecipeService: Manages recipe-related business logic, including CRUD operations and validation.
- CommentService: Manages comment-related business logic.

#### Repository
- UserRepository: Provides methods for CRUD operations on the User entity.
- RecipeRepository: Provides methods for CRUD operations on the Recipe entity.
- CommentRepository: Provides methods for CRUD operations on the Comment entity.

#### Database Design
The database design includes three main tables: User, Recipe, and Comment, connected through foreign key relationships. Each table has its respective fields to store user information, recipe details, and comments.

### Data Structure Used in the Project
The primary data structures used in the project are as follows:
- `User`: Represents the user data with fields like `id`, `username`, and other user-related information.
- `Recipe`: Represents a recipe with fields like `id`, `name`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, and a foreign key reference to the `User` who owns the recipe.
- `Comment`: Represents a comment made by a user on a recipe with fields like `id`, `content`, and foreign key references to the `User` and `Recipe`.

### Project Summary
The Recipe Management System API is built using Spring Boot with Java as the programming language. It allows users to manage recipes by performing CRUD operations on recipes, including name, ingredients, and instructions. Other users can comment on recipes, and there is a search feature to find recipes.

The project follows a well-organized structure with separate components for controllers, services, and repositories. It also incorporates validation using annotation-based techniques to ensure data integrity. Additionally, the project is designed to support secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

The database design is carefully crafted to store user data, recipe details, and comments in a structured manner. The use of foreign key relationships ensures data consistency and enables efficient data retrieval.

Overall, the Recipe Management System API provides a robust and user-friendly interface for users to store, manage, and interact with recipes, making it a valuable tool for recipe enthusiasts and food lovers.
